# YoMo 0.3

YoMo provides tools to create and feed rpm repositories for yocto.

As a new feature, YoMo provides a new work flow for yocto SDK.

The SDK provided by YoMo can be managed by dnf (install new packages, update SDK, add new rpm repository, ...)

## HTTP server

To use rpm repositories you need to have a http server.

You can find [here](doc/YoMo_http_server.md) some helpful documentation.

## Build image

To use YoMo tools you need to build a [yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org) or an [AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) image with some YoMo configuration.

You can find [here](doc/build_YoMo_image.md) some helpful documentation.

## Create rpm repositories

You can find [here](YoMo_repositories.md) the YoMo documentation about rpm repositories creation.

## Create YoMo SDK

You can find [here](YoMo_SDK.md) the YoMo documentation about YoMo SDK.
